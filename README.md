## Hi there 👋 I'm Andrew

🎓 I'm a self-taught web developer passionate about learning by building.  
💡 I believe the best way to grow is by experimenting, failing, and iterating.  
🛠️ Currently exploring JavaScript, React, Node.js, and building fullstack apps.  
🌱 Always curious about tech, design, and security.

## 🚀 What I'm working on

- Building personal projects to sharpen my frontend & backend skills  
- Improving my problem-solving through algorithm practice (LeetCode / ZTM)  
- Designing a full meal prep & fitness tracking app (React + mobile prototype)

## 📚 Learning roadmap

- Deep dive into React (components, hooks, performance)  
- CSS mastery for clean and responsive UIs  
- Backend with Node.js, Express & MongoDB  
- GitHub contributions and real-world project workflow  
- Fundamentals of cybersecurity & networking

## 🧠 Fun facts

- I’m based in Belgium and love cycling, hiking, and outdoor adventures  
- I started coding from scratch with no tech background  
- I’m building my own path one commit at a time 💪
